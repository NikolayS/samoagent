/**
 * HTTP adapter for `DELETE /account` — whole-account GDPR erasure (SPEC §5.14).
 *
 * The owner deletes their ENTIRE tenant. Every call is looped through the SAME
 * #201 per-call cascade the `/calls` surface uses ({@link eraseCallRecording} +
 * {@link purgeCallRows}): a still-LIVE bot is force-left first, its Recall
 * recording deleted, then its `transcripts`/`tokens`/`workers`/`calls` rows are
 * purged. Then the tenant's audit DETAIL is purged and a single
 * `audit_log(action='account_deleted')` tombstone is written — the durable
 * erasure record whose PRESENCE marks the tenant deleted, revoking every
 * stateless session cookie (see {@link tenantActive}). The owner's external
 * sign-in identities (`user_identities`, #209) are erased too — a privileged,
 * non-tenant-scoped delete RLS cannot reach and the FK cascade never fires for.
 * Finally a confirmation email is sent and the caller's own cookie is cleared.
 *
 * CRITICAL (defence-in-depth, §5.10): the destructive DB work runs as the
 * NON-superuser `samograph_app` role (`SET LOCAL ROLE`) with `app.tenant_id` set
 * to the CALLER's tenant, so RLS — not just app logic — CONFINES the erasure to
 * that one tenant. A cross-tenant row is invisible and cannot be touched.

/**
 * The address a §5.14-erased account's RETAINED `users` row is left holding
 * (#220). The erasure keeps the row — `tenantActive` reads its tenant's tombstone
 * to revoke every stateless session cookie — but the row must not keep the
 * person's real address, for two reasons that point the same way:
 *
 *  1. **Erasure.** An email is directly-identifying personal data. Retaining it
 *     forever on a row that exists only to say "this account is gone" is exactly
 *     the retention §5.14 promises to end.
 *  2. **Resurrection.** `users.email` is UNIQUE and every sign-in path resolves
 *     by address — `findByEmail` on the Google callback's miss branch, and
 *     `createOrLoadUser`'s upsert on the magic-link one. While the tombstone still
 *     carries the address, the next sign-in ADOPTS the erased account: the Google
 *     path wrote a fresh `user_identities` row (re-creating the provider `sub`
 *     that #218 went to the trouble of deleting) and emailed the erased address
 *     about it, then handed back a session every route 401s. Releasing the address
 *     removes the match, so a returning person is provisioned a genuinely FRESH
 *     user + tenant with no history instead of being silently re-attached to
 *     remnants — or locked out of the product forever by their own tombstone.
 *
 * DETERMINISTIC in the user id, so re-running the erasure is a no-op rather than a
 * UNIQUE violation, and `.invalid` is the RFC 2606 reserved TLD: the result can
 * never be routed, and can never collide with an address a person could own.
