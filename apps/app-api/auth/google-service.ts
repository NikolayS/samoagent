/**
 * GoogleAuthService — the two legs of "Continue with Google" (issue #209, SPEC
 * amendment S5-1; §5.16 codes 006–010).
 *
 * Shaped like `service.ts`: every dependency (OAuth provider, identity store,
 * user store, email transport, rate limiter, clock) is injected, so the whole
 * flow runs against in-memory fakes with no Google credentials, no network and
 * no database. `google-http.ts` is the thin Request→Response adapter over these
 * two methods, exactly as `http.ts` is over `AuthService`.
 *
 * THE TWO RULES THAT CARRY THE SECURITY WEIGHT (issue #209):
 *
 *  1. **`emailVerified === true` is a precondition for touching ANY store.**
 *     `users.email` is UNIQUE and `createOrLoadUser` upserts on it, so calling it
 *     with an unverified provider-asserted address is a one-line account-takeover
 *     endpoint against every existing magic-link user. The fallback is FAIL, not
 *     "then create a new user" — creating would squat the victim's address before
 *     they ever sign up. This module is the SINGLE enforcement point (the ID-token
 *     verifier and the provider deliberately only REPORT the flag), so there is
 *     exactly one place to audit.
 *  2. **Identity resolves by `(provider, subject)` FIRST, and a hit never
 *     consults email at all.** Email is used only on the miss branch. A
 *     Google-side rename is therefore a no-op rather than a lockout, and a
 *     reassigned corporate address cannot walk its new holder into the previous
 *     holder's tenant.
 *
 * Neither leg ever throws for an expected outcome: both return a typed result
 * carrying an {@link AuthErrorCode}, because every failure has to become a
 * redirect and a `throw` in the middle of that mapping is a case someone misses.
