/**
 * The signed OAuth state cookie + PKCE S256 challenge (issue #209).
 *
 * `GET /auth/google/start` mints a `state`, a `nonce` and a PKCE code verifier,
 * stashes all three in ONE tamper-evident cookie, and sends the browser to
 * Google. `GET /auth/google/callback` gets them back from that cookie and binds
 * the returning authorization code to the browser that started the flow. Without
 * that binding the callback is a login-CSRF endpoint: an attacker runs `/start`
 * himself, plants his own (cookie, state) pair, lures the victim through Google,
 * and the victim is silently signed into the ATTACKER's tenant — where all of
 * the victim's future recordings and notes then land.
 *
 * The wire format is the repo's established
 * `base64url(payloadJson) "." base64url(hmac)` shape ({@link signSession},
 * {@link issueMagicLinkToken}, `packages/shared/tokens/signing.ts`), signed with
 * the SAME `SESSION_SECRET`. Because four payload types now share one key and
 * one shape, the signing input carries a mandatory domain-separation prefix,
 * {@link OAUTH_STATE_PURPOSE} — without it a session cookie and a state cookie
 * would be byte-interchangeable, and a single future refactor that fed one to
 * the other's verifier would become session forgery. The `v1` in the prefix lets
 * the payload format rotate without ever accepting the old one.
 *
 * ORDER IS THE SECURITY PROPERTY in {@link verifyOAuthState}: constant-time HMAC
 * compare FIRST, then a strict shape whitelist, then `v`, then the TTL, then
 * (in {@link verifyOAuthStateForCallback}) the constant-time `state` compare.
 * Attacker-controlled bytes never reach `JSON.parse` before they are
 * authenticated, and no field is reachable without a valid signature.
