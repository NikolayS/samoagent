/**
 * The REAL Google adapter behind the OAuth port (issue #209, SPEC §5.1
 * amendment S5-1) — a confidential authorization-code client with PKCE S256 and
 * a nonce, terminating in a locally verified RS256 ID token.
 *
 * Shaped like `resend-email.ts`: pinned endpoint constants, an injected `fetch`
 * so every test runs with no network and no real credentials, a hard timeout so
 * a stuck endpoint fails typed instead of hanging a sign-in, a typed error class,
 * and an env-driven factory. Two things are stricter here than in the email
 * adapter, because this is a credential path:
 *
 *  - the client secret lives in a `#` private field, so it is unreachable off
 *    the instance and invisible to `JSON.stringify` / `Bun.inspect` / a logger
 *    that dumps the object;
 *  - NOTHING from Google's response is ever echoed. Google's `error_description`
 *    reflects our own request parameters back (`redirect_uri=...`,
 *    `client_secret=...` on some errors), so every failure detail here is fixed
 *    text derived from our own control flow — there is no body to redact because
 *    no body is ever read into a message.
 *
 * `googleOAuthFromEnv` must NOT be called at module top level. CI sets no
 * `SAMO_ENV`, so a module-level guard would make this file un-importable under
 * `bun test`; the server entrypoints call it inside their start functions.
