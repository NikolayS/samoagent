/**
 * The §5.16 SAMO-AUTH error reference (SPEC amendment S5-1 item 10).
 *
 * `SAMO-AUTH-006` … `010` are the Google sign-in codes. They are delivered as a
 * `302 → /auth?error=<CODE>` — a browser redirect carries no JSON body — so the
 * `httpStatus` recorded here is **302**, which S5-1 explicitly left for this PR
 * to pin.
 *
 * The `message` strings are asserted VERBATIM because they are a contract, not
 * copy: `apps/web/lib/authErrors.ts` renders the same code→copy map on the sign-in
 * page and pins the identical strings in its own tests. A silent edit on either
 * side is a user-visible drift, so both sides assert the exact bytes.
