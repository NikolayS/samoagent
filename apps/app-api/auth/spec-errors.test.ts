/**
 * The SPEC §5.16 table is the THIRD copy of the auth error copy (issue #225).
 *
 * `apps/app-api/auth/errors.ts` and `apps/web/lib/authErrors.ts` are already
 * asserted byte-for-byte against each other, because a silent edit to either is
 * a user-visible drift. Folding SPEC amendment S5-1 back into
 * `blueprints/samograph-dev/SPEC.md` adds a third place the same sentences live
 * — and a doc copy that quietly diverges from the shipped string is exactly the
 * drift the SPEC exists to prevent, only harder to notice because nothing runs
 * it. So the doc is pinned by a test too: the §5.16 table is parsed as data and
 * every `SAMO-AUTH-*` row is compared against `AUTH_ERRORS`.
 *
 * DOC-ONLY and DOM-free: it reads the markdown as text. It asserts the message
 * column, not the prose around it.
